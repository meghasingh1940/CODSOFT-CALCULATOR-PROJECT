# Calculator
Created this project using Html, Css from scratch.

<br>

The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can also perform decimal operations and display the result on the screen. The calculator will not display ansy result if you try to divide any number by zero or for an invalid expression. For example, -6++3 will not display anything. The calculator also has a clear screen feature to clear the display screen.

The project can be divided into two files: index.html and styles.css. The HTML file contains the basic structure of the calculator, including the mathematical operators, digits and decimal button, display screen, clear screen button, and calculate button. The CSS file is used to apply styles on the calculator.
